This is my personal homepage. <span id="busuanzi_container_site_pv">This site has <span id="busuanzi_value_site_pv"></span> views</span> and <span id="busuanzi_container_site_uv"><span id="busuanzi_value_site_uv"></span> visitors</span> 

The static site is generated by [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) and is deployed on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The source code is availlable on [Github](https://github.com/orianna-zzo/blog-hugo). The theme is [AllinOne](https://github.com/orianna-zzo/AllinOne), which is designed and developed by myself.

Thanks to theme [cocoa](http://github.com/nishanths/cocoa-hugo-theme) and [mdb](https://mdbootstrap.com/), I developed this theme based on these two projects.

Now it is a 3.0 version. 2.0 version is generated by Hugo with theme [cocoa](http://github.com/nishanths/cocoa-hugo-theme). 1.0 version is generated by jekyll.
